echo "1. ✅ **\`echo \"\$?\"\` Issue**: Fixed by directly handling the \$? case in variable expansion, ensuring it properly expands to the exit status even inside double quotes." >> DOLLAR_QUOTES_FIX_REPORT.md

echo "1. Modified \`expand_variables.c\` to directly handle the \$? special case" >> DOLLAR_QUOTES_FIX_REPORT.md
echo "2. Refactored \`handle_dollar\` function in \`expand_variables_utils2.c\` to better handle special cases" >> DOLLAR_QUOTES_FIX_REPORT.md

echo "1. Review the tokenization process to ensure dollar signs inside double quotes are preserved as literals" >> DOLLAR_QUOTES_FIX_REPORT.md
echo "2. Add special handling for the \`\"\$\"\$\` pattern in the lexer or parser" >> DOLLAR_QUOTES_FIX_REPORT.md
