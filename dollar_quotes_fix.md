# Dollar Quotes Handling Fix for Minishell

## Problem Description

The minishell program wasn't correctly handling the `$"string"` format, which should be treated as a literal string with the `$` character preserved. In Bash, this format is used for locale-specific translations, but in the absence of translations, it should simply be printed as `$"string"`.

For example, when running:

```bash
echo $"HOME"
```

The expected output from Bash is `$HOME` (not the value of HOME), but our minishell was incorrectly expanding this to the value of the HOME variable.

## Fix Implementation

We modified the `handle_dollar` function in `src/executor/expand_variables_utils2.c` to add special handling for `$"string"` patterns:

```c
// Special case for $"string" - in bash this is locale translation
// But we'll just treat it as literal $"string"
start = *i + 1;
if (input[start] == '\"')
{
    *i = *i + 1;  // Skip just the $ character
    return (ft_strdup("$"));  // Return $ literally
}
```

This change ensures that when we encounter a `$` followed immediately by a double quote, we treat the `$` as a literal character and continue processing the rest of the string normally.

## Testing

The fix was tested with the following commands:

```bash
echo $"HOME"          # Should output: $HOME
echo $"HOM"E$USER     # Should output: $HOME<username>
echo $"42$"           # Should output: $42$
```

This fix ensures that the minishell correctly handles the `$"string"` format according to Bash's behavior, preserving the `$` character in the output.
