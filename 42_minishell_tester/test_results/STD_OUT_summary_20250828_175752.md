## Summary of Failing Tests

| Test # | File | Line | Command | Status |
|--------|------|------|---------|--------|

## Test Categories

### Quote Handling
Tests related to handling single and double quotes, nested quotes, and escaped quotes.

### Variable Expansion
Tests for proper $VAR expansion in different contexts (quotes, command substitution).

### Command Execution
Tests for proper command parsing and execution.

### Redirections
Tests for input/output redirections (<, >, >>, <<).

### Pipes
Tests for proper pipe handling (|).

## How to Fix

1. Examine each failing test carefully
2. Compare your minishell output with bash output
3. Check the test file to understand expected behavior
4. Debug your code with the test case
