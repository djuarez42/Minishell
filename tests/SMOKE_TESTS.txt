Minishell Smoke Tests (mandatory-only)

This file documents the quick smoke suite used by tests/smoke_tests.sh.
Each case mirrors bash behavior for mandatory features and avoids bonus operators like ';' and '&&'.

1) echo_basic
   Script:
     echo hello world
   Expect:
     stdout: "hello world\n"
     stderr: empty, exit 0

2) echo_n_then_next_line
   Script:
     echo -n "no-newline"
     printf "<END>\n"
   Expect:
     stdout: "no-newline<END>\n"
     stderr: empty, exit 0

3) pwd_cd_pwd
   Script:
     pwd
     mkdir -p sub
     cd sub
     pwd
   Expect:
     stdout: two absolute paths; second ends with "/sub"; exit 0

4) env_print
   Script:
     export FOO=bar
     env | grep '^FOO='
   Expect:
     stdout: line starting with "FOO=bar"; exit 0

5) missing_cmd
   Script:
     no_such_cmd arg1
   Expect:
     stderr: "bash: line 1: no_such_cmd: command not found\n"
     exit: 127
