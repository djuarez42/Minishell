# Dollar Quotes Handling in Minishell - Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to handle dollar quotes and complex quote combinations in the Minishell project.

## Issues Fixed

1. **$"string" Syntax**: In bash, this is used for locale translation, but our shell now handles it as a literal string (without variable expansion inside)
2. **Mixed Quotes Handling**: Complex combinations like `'"'$USER'"'`, `"'"$USER"'"`, etc. now work correctly
3. **Multiple Consecutive Quotes**: Cases like `""""""$USER""""""` now work as expected
4. **Variable Expansion in Quotes**: The handling of variables inside different quote types is now aligned with bash behavior

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dollar Quotes Fix

The `handle_dollar_quotes_fix` function was added to properly handle special cases like:
- `$?` inside double quotes (expands to the exit status)
- `$"string"` syntax (treated as literal strings)
- Variable expansion in complex quote combinations

### 2. Preprocess Dollar Quotes

The `preprocess_dollar_quotes` function pre-processes input with `$"string"` patterns to ensure they're handled correctly in the parsing and expansion phases.

### 3. Quote Handling Improvements

The expansion code was updated to properly track quote context when expanding variables, ensuring that:
- Variables in double quotes are expanded but spaces are preserved
- Variables in single quotes are treated literally
- Complex nested quote combinations work correctly

### 4. Testing

Extensive testing was performed with various complex quote combinations to ensure the shell behaves correctly in all cases. All tests now pass with the implemented fixes.

## Verification

The fixes have been verified to work correctly with a comprehensive test suite that covers:
- Simple variable expansions
- Mixed quotes with variables
- Complex nested quotes
- Dollar quotes syntax
- Edge cases

Memory leaks were also checked with Valgrind, confirming that the implementation is memory-safe.
