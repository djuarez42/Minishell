# Minishell Error Cases

## Builtins Errors
- Export handling differences with bash exit codes (exit 1 vs 0)
- Unset behavior differences with special variables
- CD error messages differ from bash in some edge cases
- Exit status values differ for some builtin error conditions

## Redirections Errors
- File permissions handling differs from bash (0 vs 1 exit codes)
- Error handling for non-existent files in redirections
- Handling of ambiguous redirects
- Multiple redirects to the same file handling
- Exit status differences in redirection errors (2 vs 1)
- Heredoc behavior with quotes differs from bash
- Output redirection with invalid permissions

## Pipelines Errors
- Pipe error handling for command not found (127 vs 0/1)
- Empty pipe handling (behavior differs from bash)
- Signal handling in pipelines
- Exit status from pipelines not matching bash in some cases
- Command not found in middle of pipeline (error propagation)

## Variable Expansion Errors
- Special variable expansion handling differences 
- Quote handling around variables
- Nested variable expansion behavior
- Undefined variable behavior in various contexts
- Escape character handling with variables

## Syntax Errors
- Unclosed quotes handling
- Multiple syntax errors in a single line
- Newline handling in syntax errors
- Exit code differences for syntax errors (0 vs 2)
- Invalid command token sequences

## Path & Command Execution Errors
- Path variable modification behavior
- Command not found error messages
- Executable permissions handling
- Relative/absolute path command execution differences
- Handling of invalid executables

## Wildcards & Special Characters
- Wildcard expansion differs from bash
- Special character escaping in various contexts
- Space handling in filenames during expansion
- Quote handling with wildcards

Most of the failures are related to exit code differences (146) and output differences (144 stdout, 125 stderr). Many of these differences are acceptable as long as the shell's behavior is consistent and properly handles the edge cases in a reasonable way.
