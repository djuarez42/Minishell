# Minishell Variable Expansion Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The minishell implementation had issues with variable expansion inside double quotes:
- `echo "$?"` was showing the literal '?' character instead of expanding to the exit status
- `echo "$"$` was not correctly handling the double dollar case

## Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed the $? Issue**: Modified the variable expansion code to specifically handle the $? case directly:
   - Added code in `expand_variables.c` to directly check for and handle $? pattern
   - Updated `handle_dollar` function to better process special characters after $

## Test Results

- ✅ `echo "$?"` now correctly shows the exit status (0)
- ❌ `echo "$"$` still requires additional work to match bash behavior

## Code Changes



## Next Steps

For the remaining `"$"$` issue:

1. Review the tokenization process for dollar signs in quotes
2. Consider adding a special case for handling consecutive dollar signs
3. Implement comprehensive testing for variable expansion edge cases
